## Backend

1. Go into the `website/backend/` directory, with `cd website/backend`
2. Create a virtual environment, with `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. [Activate the environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work), with `source .venv/bin/activate` on bash/zsh.

## Fuseki
Apache Jena Fuseki server is used to create our Knowledgebase solution for applications/systems related to SmartCity. In scripts folder there is a detailed [explanation](./scripts/README.md) of each script, what data is being collected and the information that it provides.

# Docker Development

Alternatively, you can use `docker compose up --build --force-recreate --watch`, in the `website/` to start the apps.
In this case, the files will be mounted in the containers using volumes, so all changes will be reflected in the running containers (including changes in the PyPI or NPM dependencies).
